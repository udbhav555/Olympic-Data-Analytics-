## Project 3

## Project Objective

To transform complex Olympic data into an intuitive, exploration-ready dashboard that empowers users to discover performance patterns, national strengths, and historical shifts in the modern Olympic movement.

## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://github.com/udbhav555/Olympic-Data-Analytics-/blob/main/Paralympics%20Dataset%20cleaned.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Key Questions Addressed

- Which countries have dominated the Olympic medal count historically?
- How has medal distribution changed over time periods?
- Which sports award the most medals?
- How do different types of medals (gold, silver, bronze) distribute across years?
- What trends can be observed in Olympic participation and competition?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Total gold medals by country (United States leading at 1487)
- Total countries participating (73)
- Total sports in the Olympics (36)
- Total medals awarded (10,832 gold, 9,472 silver, 9,034 bronze)
- Medal distribution by sport (Athletics and Swimming leading with 4,302 and 4,191 medals)
- Medal count trends over Olympic years (peak around 1984-1988)
